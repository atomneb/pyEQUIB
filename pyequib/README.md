## pyEQUIB
**pyEQUIB** - Python package for Plasma Diagnostics and Abundance Analysis

**pyEQUIB** is a collection of [Python](https://www.python.org/) programs developed to perform plasma diagnostics and abundance analysis using emission line fluxes measured in ionzed nebulae. It uses the [AtomNeb Python Package](https://github.com/atomneb/AtomNeb-py) to read collision strengths and transition probabilities for collisionally excited lines (CEL), and recombination coefficients for recombination lines (RL). This Python package can be used to determine interstellar extinctions, electron temperatures, electron densities, and ionic abundances from the measured fluxes of emission lines.
