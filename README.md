**pyEQUIB** - Python Package for atomic level populations and line emissivities in statistical equilibrium

### Description
The **pyEQUIB** library is a collection of Python programs developed to calculate atomic level populations and line emissivities in statistical equilibrium in multi-level atoms for different physical conditions of the stratification layers where the chemical elements are ionized. This library includes the Python version of the program EQUIB, which was originally written in FORTRAN by [Howarth & Adams (1981)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981ucl..rept.....H), and was recently converted to Python.
